The latter does unsupervised and supervised classification of texts based on bags of features, and relies a lot on hierarchical clustering. I add some tree cutting and feature-to-cluster association measures, so that one can detect a high-level corpus bias, and get insight into which words might drive the clusterization.\nI am not planning releasing the package on CRAN any time soon, it is mostly used for demonstration, teaching and exploration of the corpus. You can, however, install it from Github repository. You can find a demonstration below."

    "text": "One of my main areas of work is the analysis of general patterns in verse language, prosody, and structure. I try to figure out ways to access rich formal information, such as rhythm regularity (Šeļa and Gronas 2022), and show the ways it changes over time or shapes poetic communities. In an upcoming paper, written with Mikhail Gronas, we show how simple measures of regularity and complexity allow us to map modern areas of differentiated style production (in Bourdieu’s fashion).\nA closely related field is authorship attribution of poetic texts, where differences in formal organization (rhythm, rhymes, etc.) of verse can be used to trace individual habits of poets. Together with Petr Plechác, we worked on a hilarious case of poetic mystification: one contemporary scholar forged a whole corpus of texts of a less-known Russian poet of the 19th century. Using verse features in an author verification scenario, we demonstrate conclusively (in contrast with previous work) that the origins of these texts are highly dubious (Plecháč and Šeļa 2021) .\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPlecháč, Petr, and Artjoms Šeļa. 2021. “Applications.” In Versification and Authorship Attribution, 69–91.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why do poetic meters ‘sound’ different? Some might even suggest that they have inherent meanings or purposes. The short answer to this question is that all poetic forms have a different history; they were used differently in the past and formed specific expectation horizons (often quite fuzzy). The long answer can be found in my work (that expands on previous fundamental research) (Šeļa, Plecháč, and Lassche 2022; Šeļa, Orekhov, and Leibov 2020), where I formally demonstrate that semantic features alone can predict poetic meter across traditions and languages.\nCW: LDA, clustering, adjusted Rand index, time travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nŠeļa, Artjoms, Boris Orekhov, and Roman Leibov. 2020. “Weak Genres: Modeling Association Between Poetic Meter and Meaning in Russian Poetry.” In CHR 2020: Workshop on Computational Humanities Research, 12–31.
